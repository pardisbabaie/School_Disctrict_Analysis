# School_Disctrict_Analysis
## Overview of the school district analysis
The purpose of this assignment was to help Maria, a data scientist for the school district that is responsible for analyzing the data for the district school testing to ensure accuracy. Since academic dishonesty has been found in the data but the school district wants to uphold the state standard testing, we will need to modify the data by removing the test scores for math and reading for grade 9 in Thomas high School and replacing them with Nans so that data is diregarded in our overall analysis. The goal is to identify how this will affect the data and the results.
## Results
### District Summary
The district summary is only slightly affected with the removal of the grade 9 test grades. Once the numbers are formatted to the nearest whole number there is actually no difference in the results. 
### School Summary
When looking at the school summary with the grade 9 Thomas High School test results removed, there is a big difference seen with the % passing math, % passing reading & the overall % passing results for Thomas high School. There is a significant increase from before the removal of the grade 9 test scores to after as seen below:
